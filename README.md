## Code Organization

### src/components

This folder contains general components that are used in multiple places throughout the project. They are usually generic and aren't anchored to a single user feature.

### src/features

This is where domain-specific components go.

### src/pages

Each file represents a page route on the website. Pages can be nested inside folders.
